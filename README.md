# Getting into clustering or cluster-analysis

In this project, we will be conducting Agglomerative and K-means clustering on customer demographic data to segment customers for targeted marketing. Major steps we will take in the project are :

1. Feature engineering and data cleaning
2. Scaling the data
3. Reducing the dimensionality using PCA
4. Using Elbow method to determine optimal no of clusters
5. Clustering using Agglomerative and K-means clustering
6. Checking the quality of the results using Silhoutte score
7. Checking the results of clustering
8. Interpreting the results of clustering
